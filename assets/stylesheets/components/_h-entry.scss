// Draft Properties

// The following draft properties are in use in the wild (published and consumed), and are under strong consideration, but are not yet part of the core:

// optionally embedded (or nested?) h-cite(s), each of which is a comment on/reply to the parent h-entry. See comment-brainstorming (example)
.h-entry__p-comment {
}

// the URL which the h-entry is considered a “like” (favorite, star) of. Optionally an embedded h-cite (example)
.h-entry__u-like-of {
}

// the URL which the h-entry is considered a “repost” of. Optionally an embedded h-cite.
.h-entry__u-repost-of {
}

// one or more photos that is/are considered the primary content of the entry, unless there is a p-location h-card, which is still considered a "checkin" (i.e. with a photo). Otherwise the presence of a u-photo means the name of the entry should be interpreted as a caption on the photo, and the summary/content should be interpreted as a description of the photo.
