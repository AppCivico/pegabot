/**
 * A region that contains mostly site-oriented content, rather than page-specific content.
 *
 * Site-oriented content typically includes things such as the logo or identity of the site sponsor, and site-specific search tool. A banner usually appears at the top of the page and typically spans the full width.
 *
 * Within any `document` or `application`, the author **SHOULD** mark no more than one element with the `banner` role.
