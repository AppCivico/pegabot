PegaBot is developed by the Instituto Tecnologia & Equidade (IT&E) and Institute for Tecnology and Society (ITS Rio). The analysis engine is free software and can be freely used, studied, modified and redistributed. Its code is available on [Github] (https://github.com/AppCivico/spottingbot).

Why is it important for a bot detection system to be built on free software?

Free software systems give the user the freedom to modify a code. We understand that having an open code allows the participation of society in its construction and improvement as a way of producing a more democratic knowledge of free technologies. In addition to enabling people to exchange information horizontally, it strengthens actions with digital platforms, their usage policies, and especially how disinformation networks can work using these techniques.

This initiative is also in line with the White Paper ["Systemic Recommendations to combat misinformation in the Brazilian elections"] (https://tecnologiaequidade.org.br/projects/desinformacao-em-eleicoes/), carried out by Instituto Tecnologia e Equidade ( IT&E).

In topic 5 of the document, there is the information: CREATE NEW ADJUSTMENT FEEDBACK CYCLES - in Recommendations 2019-2020. in this item, the Institute believes that "Demanding Academies and Research Institutes: development of free technologies for detecting robots, false profiles, haters and disinformation" is a point of leverage to combat the imbalances presented in the electoral system.
