Bot Spotter is still in the testing phase, the accuracy of the results will improve over time. You will soon be able to submit this error to review and correct the error. That said, detecting bots is indeed a difficult task (if it were easy, social media companies would have solved the whole problem). Our platform works by recognizing behavioral patterns. Therefore, the results should serve to complement, not replace, your own opinion.
