Bot Spotter (Pegabot) is an initiative of the Institue for Technology and Society and the Institute of Technology & Equity. Both organizations have been using their own resources for the development of this project, since they understand that making a tool like this available is essential for Latin American democracy. If you also want to support the project, write to doacoes@pegabot.com.br. For its Spanish version, Enjambre Digital and the Openlabs project have taken care of supporting the empowerment.
