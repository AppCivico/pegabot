A Twitter Bot is an account controlled by an algorithm or script, normally used to perform repetitive tasks, for example, retweeting content containing particular keywords, replying to new followers and sending direct messages to new followers. More complex Twitter Bots can participate in online conversations and, in some cases, behave very similar to human behavior. Bot accounts make up between 9 and 15% of all active Twitter accounts, but further studies indicate that this percentage may be even higher due to the difficulty in identifying complex bots. Twitter bots are generally not created with malicious intent; they are often used to improve online interaction or service delivery by companies, governments and other organizations, so it is important to separate good bots from bad bots.
