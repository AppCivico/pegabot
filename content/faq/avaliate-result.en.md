When having an indication that an account may or may not be a Bot, it is important that you make a subjective analysis of the profile you are trying to analyze. That is to say, check for the purpose that the given profile is trying to achieve. If you identify that the profile only serves to spread the message of another person, or that most of the time that profile exists to attack someone or a specific group, more the chances of this profile confirms to be a bot. In this case, it is worth questioning the possible beneficiaries of that bot's performance if the profile is really a bot and why the beneficiary is using this resource. If you are a politician, for example, ask the politician directly if he knows there is a bot working for him and if he believes that this behavior is correct.
