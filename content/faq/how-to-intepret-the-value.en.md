The higher the score, the more likely the account is to be a bot. Each profile surveyed occupies a zone of the measurer: purple, yellow or green. If the profile searched is in the purple zone, the chance of being a bot is high. Many results are classified in the yellow zone, which means that there are enough elements to suspect the use of bots, but at a lower level. It may also be a profile that is used infrequently, or a very repetitive human use. If it's green, it's probably human.
