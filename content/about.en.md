# Dismantling structural botnets

_Bots_, short for robots, are computer programs created to perform specific tasks. The first robots did not have malicious intentions, and even today there are good _bots_, whose purpose is to demand accountability from politicians, viralize causes for gender equality or help organize the (many) daily tasks of their users. Good right?

But in the late 1990s, "bots" started to develop a negative reputation. Some _bots_ were used to send SPAMs by e-mail, steal users' personal data, credit card fraud and disinformation attacks to manipulate the public sphere. These _bots_ aim to spread lies to influence narratives, a phenomenon that has been gaining global scale since 2014. These _bots_ are out there and almost nobody knows how they work, who develops them and by whom they are financed. In oder to address these issues, we launched **Bot Spotter**, a tool that brings more transparency to the use of _bots_ in Brazil.

On this platform, the user can check the activity of a social network account to know the probability of the profile being a bot. The higher the score, the greater the chance of being a bot. For now, the platform is integrated with Twitter, but soon we will support other social media.

The **Bot Spotter** is a project in partnership amongst the [Institute for Technology and Society (ITS Rio)](https://itsrio.org/) and [Instituto Equidade &amp; Tecnologia](http://tecnologiaequidade.org.br/). The platform was launched in March 2018 and is in the testing phase.
